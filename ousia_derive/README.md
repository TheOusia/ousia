# ousia_derive

Procedural macros for [Ousia](https://crates.io/crates/ousia) — a graph-relational ORM with built-in double-entry ledger for Rust.

This crate is an implementation detail of `ousia`. You should not depend on it directly.

```toml
[dependencies]
ousia = "1.0"
```

The macros in this crate (`OusiaObject`, `OusiaDefault`) are re-exported from `ousia` and documented there.
